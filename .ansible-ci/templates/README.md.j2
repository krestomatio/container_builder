## CONTAINER_BUILDER
This project builds containers using Ansible. The containers are defined as hosts in the Ansible inventory. They are generated using host and group variables, templates and local connection.

### Containers build info
| Container Directory  | Container Image  | Version  |
|---|---|---|
{% for ctr in doc_ctr_names | default(ansible_play_hosts,true) %}
{% set ctr_state = lookup('vars', ctr | replace('-', '_') | lower + '_image',default=False) %}
| [{{ ctr_state.variant_name }}]({{ ctr_state.relative_path | default(ctr) }}/)| [{{ ctr_state.repo_digest.split('@')[0] }}](https://{{ ctr_state.repo_digest.split('@')[0].split(':')[0] }}) | {{ ctr_state.version }} |
{% endfor %}

### How to build them?
```bash
ansible-playbook .ansible-ci/build.yml
```

### Requirements
* Ansible >= 2.9
* docker or podman
* python docker
* [buildx](https://github.com/docker/buildx)
* see [requirements.txt](.ansible-ci/requirements.txt)

### Want to contribute?
* Context and dockerfile templates are inside each container's [directory](.ansible-ci/files/templated_contexts/). Some contexts and templates are reused by more than one container. Their respective variables generate different contexts in each container generated directory
* Variables can be changed inside [the inventory](.ansible-ci/inventory) dir
* Please modify or update only [templated context](.ansible-ci/files/templated_contexts/) or [the inventory](.ansible-ci/inventory)
